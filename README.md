# Mentoring Scheme

My objectives are question based and aimed to prepare me for the game developer career. By the end of the mentoring scheme I want to answer the following questions: 

 1. What hard skills are most important for a game programmer.
 2. What soft skills are most important for a game programmer and what are better ways to acquire these skills.
 3. What game development organisations should I consider starting my career. 
 4. What internships can I enter to be better prepared for the career. 
 
 To start answering the questions I am going to read It and Technology part of a Target jobs journal. After the answers are gained, I am going to start preparing for the career and writing CV and portfolio.
