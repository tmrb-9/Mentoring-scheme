# Mentoring Scheme

My objectives are question based and aimed to prepare me for the game developer career. By the end of the mentoring scheme I want to answer the following questions: 

 1. What hard skills are most important for a game programmer.
 2. What soft skills are most important for a game programmer and what are better ways to acquire these skills.
 3. What game development organisations should I consider starting my career. 
 4. What internships can I enter to be better prepared for the career. 
 
 To start answering the questions I am going to read It and Technology part of a Target jobs journal. After the answers are gained, I am going to start preparing for the career and writing CV and portfolio. 
 
 Goals for the next session:
  1. Examine 3 game portfolios. Based on that determine the level of difficulty of a future game project by the end of October.
  2. By the end of October, prepare for a game programming interview by:
       a. watching 3 videos on youtube.com and summarizing key points;
       b. researching top 5 interview questions;
       c. and observing 3 programming test examples.
  3. Learn basics of Python watching a 4.5 hours video on youtube.com by freeCodeCamp, solve 3 python practice problems for an interview from realpython.com, and compare my solutions with the given.
